    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SPORTSIQ AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS

        WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitations of liability, so some of the
        above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless SportsIQ and its affiliates from any claims, damages, losses,
        liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the App, your violation of these

    <h3>Governing Law</h3>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Minnesota, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h3>Arbitration</h3>
    <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the App shall be resolved through binding arbitration in
        accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except where prohibited by law. You waive
        your right to participate in class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration.</p>

    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
    <p>Either party may seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property infringement or unauthorized access.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Terms in the
        App, updating the "Last Updated" date, or sending an email notification for significant changes.</p>

        requirements.</p>
    <p>Upon termination, your license to use the App ends immediately, we may delete your account and data, and sections
        of these Terms that should survive will remain in effect.</p>

    <h2>16. General Provisions</h2>
    <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and SportsIQ regarding
        the App.</p>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in
        full force and effect.</p>
    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or
        provision.</p>
    <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and
        obligations without restriction.</p>
    <p>These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship between you and
        SportsIQ.</p>
    <p>We are not liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</p>
